# Travel Time Request App
This is a simple web app designed to help City staff self-serve their data needs for averaged automotive travel times, which we usually source from [HERE](https://github.com/CityofToronto/bdit_data-sources/tree/master/here). Currently these needs are handled through a more time-consuming data request process. 

This app was originally developed as a [class project by U of T students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6lnefduogo) in partnership with the City. It is currently deployed inside the City network at [https://10.160.2.198/traveltime-request/](https://10.160.2.198/traveltime-request/).

For information on app development and deployment, see [Running the App](./running-the-app.md).
